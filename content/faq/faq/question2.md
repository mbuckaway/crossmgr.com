Yes!

CrossMgr has full, real-time integration with J-Chip, Alien and Impinj readers.  J-Chip is an active chip system, Alien and Impinj use passive (disposable) chips.

Putting together a passive chip reading system is explained in detail in CrossMgrImpinjReadme.pdf (see here).  This system was created for the Midweek cycling club in Toronto, Ontario, and is used for their weekly criterium series.  It describes all the equipment, vendors and techniques to build a robust system with a very high read rate.

You can use an Alien reader instead of an Impinj reader (used Alien readers come up frequently on eBay often for much reduced prices).
If you are handy, have the technical capability equivalent to setting up a network printer, and have a few hours to spend, you can be successful at this project.

If you are looking for a highly accurate and high-quality out-of-the-box solution, consider J-Chip.  However, J-Chip uses "active" chips which are considerably more expensive than the disposable ones.
