Short answer: No.
All versions of CrossMgr are backwards-compatible with each other in data format.
Just install the new version and go (Windows, MacOSX and Linux).

Note: CrossMgr is not forwards-compatible.  For example, if you write a file with a newer version then those features are not going to work in an older version of the software.
