(This process is about to be revamped and use Githup Sponsorships)

You can help the development of CrossMgr by donating.

If you are using CrossMgr for club events with no entry fee, or kids races (U17 and younger), then there is no recommended donation.
If you are using CrossMgr for races with an entry fee, the recommended donation is $0.25 for each 17+ rider for each race (U17 riders are free).

For example, if you have 100 riders at your event who are 17+, consider a donation of $25.

This donation is for each rider and event only.  Download as many copies of CrossMgr as you like, and run as many copies of CrossMgr at the same time at your race - no problem (this is recommended if you want a backup).

Making a donation is easy:

* Login to PayPal.  If you do not have an account, Sign Up for one.
* In your PayPal account, click on the “Send Money” tab.
* In the “To” field, enter: edward.sitarski@gmail.com
* Enter the Amount: = $0.25 X #Adults (17 years and older)
* Click on the “Personal” tab.
* Then click on “Gift”.
* Press Continue and follow the rest of the PayPal instructions.

Make sure to send me an email so I can thank you personally.

Thanks again for your support.
