CrossMgr and related tools are 64 bit applications. 32 bit systems are not supported. The following operating systems are supported:

* Windows 10 64 bit
* MacOSX Catalina 10.15 (should also work on Mojava 10.14)
* Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 or newer)

Older versions of Windows, MacOSX and Linux are not compatible with the binary releases. You are welcome to download the should and build the application yourself for older OS versions, but we will not provide any support.
