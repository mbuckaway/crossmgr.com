CrossMgr is used for race timing and results specifically for cycling races. CrossMgr quickly produces professional looking results including rider lap times.  It reads rider data from Excel or RaceDB, and formats results in Excel format or Html for publishing to the web.  CrossMgr also interfaces with various online registration vendors. CrossMgr was created by a cycling official, and has extensive features to settle disputes.

CrossMgr is designed to handle many times of bike races including Cyclocross, Road, MTB and Track. It has support for RFID timing chips including JChip, Impinj and others. In addition to the usual race types, it supports Time Trials.  It fully supports Performance Factors for Paracycling.
